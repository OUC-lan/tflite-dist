# tflite-dist
As of today there is no pre-build distribution of TensorFlow Lite C++ libraries and headers, this repository is sort of a distribution that can be used in order to use TF lite in C++ on mobile.

# Download
You can find the distribution zip under [releases](https://github.com/ValYouW/tflite-dist/releases)

# What's included
The release zip contains a `headers` folders with all required headers, and `libs` folder with libraries for Android and iOS. The Android libraries are dynamic while the iOS lib is static.

# Any Example?
I wrote a series of blog posts on [cross-platform object detection using TF lite](https://www.thecodingnotebook.com/2019/11/cross-platform-object-detection-with.html)
